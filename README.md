Simple/Sophisticated Tracking for Audio Visual Environments (SSTAVE).

Project funded by Canada Council for the Arts

A set of tools for laptop performance, with specific attention to networked laptop ensembles.
Tools made using SuperCollider, Fluxus and Processing.  Emphasis on audio visual laptop performance.



So far:

- LeapDef: A set of tools in SuperCollider and Fluxus for use with the Leap Controller. Still in Progress, use at own risk.

- Live Coding Swarm game development tools for use with Processing and SuperCollider. To be used in conjunction with Utopia, a SuperCollider library for the creation of networked music applications, and builds upon the work of the Republic Quark and other existing network systems in SuperCollider. This is available here: https://github.com/muellmusik/Utopia

More tools will be become available in due course.
